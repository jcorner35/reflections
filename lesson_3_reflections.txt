When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A remote repository is useful in several ways. 
When collabarating with others on the same project, having the project stored locally makes it difficult to get the changes others have made.
Having a remote repository allows you to easily 'pull' others changes, as well as 'push' your own.
Having a remote repository makes it easier to get help.
Finally and perhaps most importantly having a remote repository also backs up your code. 
Should anything catastrohpic happen to your pc, you will not lose your data if it is stored remotely.
