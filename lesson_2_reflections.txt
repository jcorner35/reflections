What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When a new repository is initialized it changes the directory from a normal folder into a git repository.
Hidden files containing git meta-data are created. These files allow other git commands, such as git commit to be performed on the directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area allows the user to specify which modified files should be part of a commit.
This allows the user to separate modified files into logical commits, rather than committing unrealated files together.
The staging area contains a subset of the files in the working directory, those that have been modified and selected to be committed.
The staging area is different from the repository in that the staging area alone does not allow for any of benifits the repository gives you. 
Files must be committed to the repository in order for log, diff and checkout to function.
